	<p>When it comes to describing what an RWB Porsche is, the simple answer is that it's a customized, widebody Porsche 911 built by noted Japanese tuner Akira Nakai. But the real answer is far more complicated. These extensively modified 911s, with exaggerated fender flares, gigantic wings, deep-dish wheels, and exposed rivets, make RWB Porsches extremely polarizing and controversial vehicles—especially among the diehard Porsche faithful. RWB-modified cars are viewed as either rolling works of art created by a master car tuner, or blasphemous, caricatured monstrosities created by a rogue car-toon-er. But in a world starved for its next trending IG post, the one thing both sides can agree on is that RWB Porsches will always provoke a reaction.

	<h2 class="before-text">RWB</h2>
	<p>Founded in 1997, RWB stands for Rauh-Welt Begriff. In German, rauh-welt roughly translates to "rough world," though the last word (depending on where you choose to look for a translation) can mean either "expression," "style," or "concept." The phrase itself is meant to reflect two separate but related ideas. The first is the admittedly imperfect style in which Nakai imagines his custom machines, sometimes using nothing but his eyes and an air-powered saw to cut a line into a classic Porsche. The second is to mirror the aggressive manner in which Nakai likes to drive his own cars. He believes that sports cars—even one-offs as unique as his creations—are meant to be driven hard and not relegated to being garage prisoners for the entirety of their existence.</p>

	<h2>History of RWB</h2>
	<img src="/images/nakai.jpg" alt="Nakai">
	<p>Akira Nakai was introduced to Porsches while working at a body shop to help fund his drift club, known as Rauh-Welt, aka "Rough World." The first RWB Porsche started as a beat-up, air-cooled 930-Series 911 that Nakai bought for himself. He cut weight everywhere and anywhere from the car, upgraded the engine to make 360 horsepower, installed a full race suspension, and of course created an incredibly dramatic body kit. The result was a 2,100-pound car he named Stella Artois, after his favorite beer.</p>
